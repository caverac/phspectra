## Speed comparison

We benchmark the wall-clock time for decomposing 1001 real GRS spectra (424 channels each) using both PHSpectra and GaussPy+ ([Riener et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10506)). Both algorithms are run on the same spectra with their recommended configurations:

- **PHSpectra**: $\beta = 3.8$ (default), pure Python
- **GaussPy+**: two-phase decomposition with $\alpha_1 = 2.89$, $\alpha_2 = 6.65$ (trained values from [Riener et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10506), Sect. 4.1), SNR threshold = 3.0

### Results

| Metric                    | PHSpectra | GaussPy+ | Factor         |
| ------------------------- | --------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Total time (1001 spectra) | 131.7 s   | 737.8 s  | **5.6&times;** |
| Mean per spectrum         | 131.6 ms  | 737.1 ms | 5.6&times;     |
| Median per spectrum       | 89.3 ms   | 699.5 ms | 7.8&times;     |
| Mean components detected  | 2.44      | 2.38     | &mdash;        |

PHSpectra is **5.6&times; faster** than GaussPy+ on identical real survey data.

### Why PHSpectra is faster

The speed advantage comes from algorithmic differences:

1. **No smoothing sweep.** GaussPy+ convolves the spectrum with a family of Gaussian kernels at each $\alpha$ scale, computing derivatives at every scale. The two-phase decomposition repeats this process twice (once per $\alpha$). PHSpectra skips smoothing entirely &mdash; it operates directly on the raw spectrum using persistence-based peak detection, which is $O(n)$ in the number of channels.

2. **Fewer optimization steps.** GaussPy+ fits all candidate components simultaneously using `scipy.optimize.leastsq`, sometimes iterating multiple times as it adds or removes components. PHSpectra fits each component in a localized window and performs a single global refinement pass.

3. **No training required.** GaussPy+'s $\alpha$ parameters must be trained per survey (or per survey region), which adds a separate computational cost not reflected in the per-spectrum timing. PHSpectra's $\beta$ parameter requires no training &mdash; the default value works across surveys.

4. **Spread in execution times.** GaussPy+'s execution time varies widely across spectra, due to complex optimization landscapes. PHSpectra's execution time is more consistent, with fewer outliers.

### Benchmark details

- **Hardware**: single-core sequential processing for both tools (no parallelization)
- **PHSpectra**: native Python 3.14, run directly
- **GaussPy+**: Python 3.10 in Docker (required for compatibility with legacy numpy/scipy), batch decomposition via `GaussPyDecompose`, per-spectrum timing via GaussPy core decomposer
- **Spectra**: 1001 randomly selected GRS pixels with at least one cataloged component, 424 velocity channels each
